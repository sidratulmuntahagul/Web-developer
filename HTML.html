  <p><strong>Assalam u alaikum</strong> my name is Sidra I'm a junior software but Now also i learn about
     this for best to best result </p>
<p>Today my topic on "Advantages and Disadvantages of Laptop" Mostly peoples are use Laptop more than
   Computer but every thing have good or bad affects If people use laptop on limit so it was good for
    every one but if we use un limit then our eyes are effected. Children are very use laptop then they
     not focus on exams and mostly chidren are failed on exams and our play time also wasted on laptop. 
     But if we both are on level then Laptop is good for us.Just like that more things are very bad for 
     our new generation whose name are as follows </p>
<ul><li>mobile phones</li>
<li>computer</li>
<li>pubg game</li>
<li>Tik tok</li></ul><br/>
