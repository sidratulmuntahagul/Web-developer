<h1><strong>Loveliest of Trees ,the Cherry Now</strong></h1>
<p>Loveliest of trees,the cherry now<br/>
  Is hung with bloom along the bough,<br/>
  And stands about the woodland ride<br/>
  Wearing white for Eastertide.<br/>
</p>


<p>Now,of my threescore years and ten,<br/>
    Twenty will not come again,<br/>
And take from seventy springs a score,<br/>
     It only Leaves me fifty more.<br/>
</p>

<p>And since to Look at things in bloom<br/>
  Fifty springs are Little room,<br/> 
  About the woodlands I will go<br/>
  To see the cherry hung with snow.<br/>
